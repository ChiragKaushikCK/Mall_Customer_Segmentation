# âž¤ Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Welcome to my project on **Customer Segmentation**!  
In this notebook, I applied unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify different types of customers based on their shopping behavior â€” a key step for businesses to offer personalized experiences.

## âž¤ Project Overview

Customer segmentation is crucial in today's competitive market. By analyzing customer data from a mall, I segmented customers into meaningful groups using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm. This helps businesses:

- Target the right audience with the right offers
- Personalize communication
- Optimize product placement and promotions

## âž¤ Features Used

- ðŸ‘¤ Age  
- ðŸ’° Annual Income  
- ðŸ“ˆ Spending Score (1â€“100)

These features provide deep insights into spending patterns and lifestyle behaviors of shoppers.

## âž¤ Techniques and Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned the data  
   - Checked for missing values  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution and scatter plots for understanding data trends  
3. **Elbow Method**  
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters (`k`)  
4. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - Applied clustering to segment customers  
5. **Visualization**  
   - 2D and 3D plots to visualize the segmented clusters

## âž¤ Key Insights

- Some customers with high income spend less â€” indicating potential for targeted campaigns.
- Younger customers often fall into higher spending categories.
- Well-defined clusters highlight unique customer groups based on behavior and income.

## âž¤ Dataset Information

- ðŸ“„ **Mall Customer Dataset**  
- ðŸ“Š 200 records of customers  
- ðŸ§¾ Columns: Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score  

> This is a popular dataset for clustering tasks and is widely used for learning purposes.
