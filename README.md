 #> Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Welcome to my project on Customer Segmentation using data from a shopping mall! This notebook walks through how we can use unsupervised machine learning techniques to better understand customer behavior and divide them into meaningful segments.

#>  About the Project
Businesses today rely heavily on data-driven insights to improve customer experience and increase revenue. This project aims to group mall customers into distinct clusters based on key features like:

Age

Annual Income

Spending Score

These clusters help businesses make smarter decisions when it comes to marketing, product placement, and personalized offers.

#> Techniques Used
Data Exploration: We start with visual exploration of patterns using plots like scatterplots and distribution charts.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prep the data for clustering.

Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

K-Means Clustering: The core ML algorithm used for grouping customers.

Visualization of Clusters: Final clusters are visualized in 2D and 3D space to understand the patterns and segments clearly.

#> Key Findings
Customers naturally fall into a few different types—some are high spenders with low income, others are low spenders with high income, and a group that spends moderately.

Age and income often play a big role in spending behavior, but not always in expected ways.

#> Visual Output
Here’s a sneak peek of what you’ll see:

Clustered scatterplots
